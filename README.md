# Masonry-Gallery-w-Django-CSS-JS

Gallery app for display pictures with django using CSS for the display and JS for modal view.

# Introduction

For this project, I will display a gallery app with django, allowing to display a masonry like view of the gallery, adding, editing and deleting pictures, view them through modal and adding hashtags.

For the project the requirements are: 
  - Django, to create the project, app, handling the model and views.
  - Pillow, to handle the pictures, save them and create thumbnails.
  - Django-multiupload, to handle the multiple upload of pictures.
  - Jquery and Select2 to search tags to add to pictures.
  - Bootstrap

For the masonry view, I will use the CSS created by [Manu Morante](https://github.com/manumorante) from his repository [mm-masonry](https://github.com/manumorante/mm-masonry.git). You can see all the options on the [dedicated section of his page](https://masonry.manumorante.com/).
